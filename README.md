### Hello

Hello!  This is where I store just about all the stuff I'm working on.  I love to code and I try to just have fun with it and build whatever sounds entertaining.
You'll find lots of stuff here.  From things that might be useful, to things that might be educational or interesting, to things that are just kind of dumb but
are fun nonetheless.  I love programming and hopefully that comes through with all of the stuff I put up on here.  

I've got my own little blog over at https://zhaba.dev where I post all kinds of CS related stuff. I like to document my projects, write tutorials about things I 
think are interesting and just share my thoughts.  

- My main project right now is a tool for comparing sorting algorithms written in C. 
  
- I always try to keep myself busy when it comes to learning and practicing CS topics.  I'm spending most of my time trying to deepen my understanding of C through
  more complex projects.  I'd also like to learn more about a more modern language, either Go, Haskell, or Rust.  I've got a few MOOCs in store for each of them
  to figure out which I like best  Functional programming is scary but I'm also fascinated by it.
  
  
- My other hobbies mainly center around literature and translation.  My two main foreign languages are Russian and Japanese and I love to translate 
  literature from both languages when I have some spare time.  I like to study them when I can.  I also love doing computer art, like 3D modeling 
  and pixel art.  I also just got a 3D printer and have been having a lot of fun modeling things in blender, printing them and then painting them.
