### Hi there 

Hello!  This is where I store just about all the stuff I'm working on.  I love to code and I try to just have fun with it and build whatever sounds entertaining.
You'll find lots of stuff here.  From things that might be useful, to things that might be educational or interesting, to things that are just kind of dumb but
are fun nonetheless.  I love programming and hopefully that comes through with all of the stuff I put up on here.  

I've got my own little blog over at https://zhaba.dev where I post all kinds of CS related stuff. I like to document my projects, write tutorials about things I 
think are interesting and just share my thoughts.  

- I'm currenlty working on a cool todo app with github integration along with fumbling through building some basic interpreter/compiler.
- I'm currently learning more about C and linux system programming, learning some rust, bash scripting, and GUI programming when I can
  and just trying to keep working on the things I find most interesting
  
- My other hobbies mainly center around literature and translation.  I speak Russian and Japanese and love learning languages.
