### Hello

Hello!  This is where I store just about all the stuff I'm working on.  I love to code and I try to just have fun with it and build whatever sounds entertaining.
You'll find lots of stuff here.  From things that might be useful, to things that might be educational or interesting, to things that are just kind of dumb but
are fun nonetheless.  I love programming and hopefully that comes through with all of the stuff I put up on here.  

I've got my own little blog over at https://zhaba.dev where I post all kinds of CS related stuff. I like to document my projects, write tutorials about things I 
think are interesting and just share my thoughts.  

- My main project right now is an expression evaluator in C.  It's not much, but I think it's a good first step to learning more about how 
  interpreters and compilers work. 
  
- I'm currently learning about linux systems programming, learning more about C and taking some MOOCs for bash scripting.  
  
- My other hobbies mainly center around literature and translation.  My two main foreign languages are Russian and Japanese and I love to translate 
  literature from both languages when I have some spare time.  I also try to learn more languages when I can.  I also love working on computer art like 
  3D modeling and pixel art.  I'm hoping to get into 3D printing soon too.
