### Hello

Hello!  This is where I keep all the stuff I'm working on, along with any notes that I might need in the future.  I love programming more than anything and, 
regardless of code quality, I hope that comes through. 

You'll find lots of stuff here.  From things that might be useful, to things that might be educational or interesting, to things that are just kind of dumb but
fun nonetheless.

I've got my own little blog over at https://zhaba.dev where I post all kinds of CS related stuff. I like to document my projects, write tutorials about things I 
think are interesting and just share my thoughts.  

- My main project right now is going through the great book *Crafting Interpreters* by Bob Nystrom.  I've been very interested in compilers and interpreters
  but the standard books (Dragon book and SICP) have been a bit too difficult to just jump right into.  *Crafting Interpreters* so far seems like the best 
  resource I could have possibly asked for and I'm beyond excited to dive deeper into it.
  
-  Currently, I write most of my projects in C.  I've been playing around a bit with Rust and Go, and also trying to learn some Haskell (functional programming
   is so interesting, but I can't write anyting productive in Haskell yet).
  
- My other hobbies mainly center around literature and translation.  My two main foreign languages are Russian and Japanese and I love to translate 
  literature from both languages when I have some spare time.  I like to study them when I can.  I also love doing computer art, like 3D modeling 
  and pixel art.  I also just got a 3D printer and have been having a lot of fun modeling things in blender, printing them and then painting them.
